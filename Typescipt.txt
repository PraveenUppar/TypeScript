TypeScript is JavaScript with static types. It adds a type system that checks code at compile-time rather than runtime.

Why TypeScript?

- Catch errors before runtime
- Better IDE autocompletion and IntelliSense
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring
- Better for large-scale applications

How does typescript code run?
Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 
Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript
When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking
tsc is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript
