TypeScript is JavaScript with static types. It adds a type system that checks code at compile-time rather than runtime.

Why TypeScript?

- Catch errors before runtime
- Better IDE autocompletion and IntelliSense
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring
- Better for large-scale applications

How does typescript code run?
Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 
Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript
When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking
tsc is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript

# For Quick testing
npm install -g typescript
tsc --version 
tsc --init
npm install -g ts-node

# For large project
npm install -g typescript
tsc --version 
tsc --init
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node

# Commands
To run the ts file = "ts-node index.ts",
To build the ts file in dist: "tsc",
To run the js from the dist: "node dist/index.js"
